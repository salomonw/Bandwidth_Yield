## Bandwidth Yield Management Problem

Yield Management Systems (YMs) (also known as Revenue Management Systems) are broadly used in service industries that oer perishable goods such as airline tickets, hotel rooms or car rentals. The main objective of these systems is to sell all the available inventory by maximizing the company's profits. In practice, YMs are generally variable pricing strategies that inuence customers behavior.
Motivated by the yield management problem, it is natural to ask: how should communication companies create pricing strategies for networks such as the internet or telecommunications. This problem is commonly referred to as the Bandwidth Yield Management Problem and it is generally complex and multi-faceted.

The objective of the Bandwidth Yield Management Problem is to select the price that maximizes the profit of a network provider (e.g. telecommunication, TV, internet) when demand and service time of the bandwidth are sensitive to price and capacity is infinite.
